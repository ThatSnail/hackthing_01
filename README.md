01: What Would Markov Say?
====================================

Go play with this: http://what-would-i-say.com/

"It's pretty cool," says you. But WHY? Well, my friend, you've just stumbled upon a bigram word model, a.k.a. depth-2 Markov Chain.
"Wow, that sounds fancy. I'll never be able to build something like that."

Well, consider yourself wrong!

Markov chains are super-straightforward and very applicable to a bunch of things. And if everything goes well, by the end of the two hours you will have your very own super-special Markov system.

OVERVIEW:
----------
Basic Terminal Commands
    * ls
    * cd
    * mv
    * rm
    * mkdir

Markov Chain - Algorithm Overview
    * What is a Markov Chain?
    * Programming it in Python
    * Testing it on sample data

Retrieving Data from Other Websites
    * Using "curl" to grab web pages
    * Using regex to parse pages and save them to files

Extra: Linking With Twitter
    * The Twitter API
    * OAuth magic (via tmhOAuth)

SETUP:
-------
1) Download Python 3.x: http://python.org/download/

2) Get a shell:

For Windows:

    Download Cygwin: http://cygwin.com/install.html

    *** Will update with better instructions later ***

    NOTE: For Windows users, I strongly recommend setting up a virtual machine with VirtualBox and Ubuntu or one of its variants, but the process is nuanced and I can understand if you don't want to set up something so heavy. But Cygwin really sucks.

For Macintosh & Linux:

    You already have a shell! Yay!

    (except Macs don't have apt-get or gcc installed by default but hopefully we won't touch those for now)

3) Get a text editor:

Vim:

    http://www.vim.org/download.php

        or type

    sudo apt-get install vim

        in Terminal

Emacs: 

    http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/#Obtaining

        or type

    sudo apt-get install emacs

        in Terminal

    * I don't actually know how to use Emacs.

4) Make sure the commands "curl" and "wget" run from your shell.

    *** Will update with better instructions later ***

5) OPTIONAL: Get git

For Windows:

    http://git-scm.com/download/win

For Mac:

    http://git-scm.com/download/mac

For Linux:

    In Terminal:

        sudo apt-get install git
